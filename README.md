# LYT-ListYourTasks

 Here I have done few things as :
- Splash Screen
- Login with selfie profile registration
- Home with hamburger menu and quick switch of items.
- Home to be divided into complete and pending tasks with option of swipe to complete or delete. Can switch between list and grid mode.
- Save a todo item similar to Google Keep (images, text formatting, attachments, loction). Use local store for this.
- Service to provide notification of remaining tasks.
- Making app both mobile and tablet compatible.
